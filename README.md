## core-py
- A place for my python code files/assignments

#### Motivation
- Most of the time I have seen people looking for practice problems after learning a python concept. The challenge with a lot of python books is that after explaining a certain topic, author just moves to the next chapter. (without well defined exercises)
- Additionally there are days when we feel burnt out by week's hard work, and look for ways to revise previously learnt concepts.

#### Solution: 
- I have created this repository to be a `perfect daily dose` for anyone with intermediate problem skills in python. It contains a plethora of python problems that I have solved over time.
- Additionally I browse through various python exercises available freely on University sites, and keep adding to the list whenever I find something interesting. 
- You can pick any problem, give it a shot and check the answer. 
- I believe in constant learning. Therefore, please feel free to suggest any improvement to solved problems if you feel so.
