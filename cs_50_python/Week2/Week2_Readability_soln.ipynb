    "- Design and implement a program that computes the `Coleman-Liau` index of the text.\n",
    "- Your program should count the number of letters, words, and sentences in the text. You may assume that a letter is any lowercase character from a to z or any uppercase character from A to Z, any sequence of characters separated by spaces should count as a word, and that any occurrence of a period, exclamation point, or question mark indicates the end of a sentence.\n",
    "- Your program should print as output `Grade X` where X is the grade level computed by the Coleman-Liau formula, rounded to the nearest integer.\n",
    "- If the resulting index number is 16 or higher (equivalent to or greater than a senior undergraduate reading level), your program should output `Grade 16+` instead of giving the exact index number. If the index number is less than 1, your program should output `Before Grade 1`.\n",
