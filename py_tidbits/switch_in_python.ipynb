    "- Python doesn't have a default <b>switch()</b> implementation\n",
    "- <u>if-elif-else </u> can be used to relace the logic within code where switch() might be needed; **but**:-\n",
    "    * if-elif-else is `sequential` \n",
    "    * Therefore, each branch will be executed one after the other till the condition is met\n",
    "    * if the condition is satisfied by `else` block, all of if-elif check needs to happen in code \n",
    "    * This might be time consuming for very large branches\n",
    "    \n",
    "- A quick workaround is to use dictionaries(<u>key:value</u>) and functions (<u>functions are 1st class citizens!</u>) for basic equality checks.\n",
